## Introduction

Generative AI has transformed the way we interact with machines, enabling them to produce human-like text and responses. By integrating retrieval mechanisms, RAG leverages a vast amount of information to produce more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. This project utilizes LangChain, a framework that simplifies the integration of language models and data retrieval systems.
